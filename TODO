Generic stuff
-------------

  * Make morpheus self-hosting.
  * Enable booting the image without editing the root partition name
      (this is needed to easily boot from usb from different machines)
  * Separate out packages in their own directories.  For the kernel this
      would be pkgs/kernel/build and pkgs/kernel/config-$arch etc.

Packages
--------

  * e2fsprogs
  * Install tic as part of ncurses.
  * Create an hwclock service file.
  * Create a tinyalsa service file.
  * Build musl from source.
  * Build kernel with our cross-compiler.
