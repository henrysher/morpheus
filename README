morpheus - a statically linked musl based Linux distro
======================================================

Building
--------

To  build  morpheus you  currently  need  an  x86_64 based  host  with
multilib support  or an x86  host.  You will  need to have  mk(1) from
9base or plan9port.

Please review `config.mk' prior to building and adjust any parameters.

To build everything:

  mk world

To build specific packages:

  mk pkg1 pkg2 ...

To force build packages and all their dependencies:

  mk -a pkg1 pkg2 ...

To clean the build system's cache:

  mk clean

To clean everything including the downloaded files and the rootfs:

  mk clean-world

To fetch all packages without building anything:

  mk fetch-world

Installing
----------

There is currently no installer.  There is a script that creates a 4GB
image file that is suitable to dd to a usb stick.

To create a bootable image:

  sudo modprobe -r loop
  sudo modprobe loop max_part=15 # to be done only once
  sudo mk bootable # this invokes stuff/create-bootable

Make sure to change  the kernel command line to point  it to your root
device.  You  can either do this  before creating the image  or at the
boot prompt as follows:

  bzImage root=/dev/sd[X]1 rootwait init=/init ro

Testing
-------

To experiment with the x86_64 image in qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -hda morpheus-x86_64-0.0.img -enable-kvm -vga cirrus

Login with root and an empty password.

To obtain binary images go to http://dl.2f30.org/morpheus-img/

Enjoy!
