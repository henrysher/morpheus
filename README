Morpheus is a statically linked musl based distro.

To build the world use `fakeroot ./stage0'.

To build  a particular  package use `fakeroot  ./pkgbuild <pkg-path>'.
You will then need to repack the rootfs with `fakeroot ./repack'.

After you've  created the rootfs you  can build a bootable  image with
`sudo ./create-bootable'.  You can dd this image to a USB stick if you
need to.

Execute `qemu-run' (you will need vde_switch and slirpvde).

Login with `root' and an empty password.

Enjoy!
