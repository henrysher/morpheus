Morpheus is a statically linked musl based distro.

The base system includes sbase[1], ubase[2], sdhcp[3], smdev[4]
as well as other tools.

To build the  world use `fakeroot ./stage0'.  You need  an x86_64 host
to build morpheus.

To build a particular package  use `fakeroot ./pkgbuild pkgpath'.

After you've created  the ramdisk you can build a  bootable image with
`sudo ./create-bootable'.  You can dd this image to a USB stick if you
need to.

Login with `root' and an empty password.

Enjoy!
