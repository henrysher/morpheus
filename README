Morpheus is a statically linked musl based toy distro.

The base system includes  sbase[1], ubase[2], sdhcp[3], smdev[4], mksh
as well as other tools.

To build the  world use `./stage0'.  You need an  x86_64 host to build
morpheus.  Please review the  `prepare-env' script and adjust anything
needed.

Morpheus has been build-tested on Debian 7.0, Archlinux, Slackware and
Ubuntu 13.04.

To build specific packages:

  ./pkgbuild pkg1 pkg2 ...

After you've built stage0 you can create a bootable image:

  sudo modprobe -r loop
  sudo modprobe loop max_part=15 # to be done only once
  sudo ./create-bootable

This creates a 4GB image.  You can dd this image to a USB stick if you
want to.  Make sure  to change the kernel command line  to point it to
your root device.  You can either do this before creating the image or
at the boot prompt as follows:

  bzImage root=/dev/sd[X]1 rootwait init=/init ro

Login with root and an empty password.
