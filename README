To build use `fakeroot ./build'

Run `qemu-run' (you will need vde_switch and slirpvde).

Login with `root' and an empty password.

To start the network use `sh /etc/netstart'.

Some of the packages are pulled from http://dl.2f30.org/morpheus-pkgs/
others are cloned from http://git.2f30.org.

To build a particular package use `./pkgbuild <package>'.

Enjoy!
