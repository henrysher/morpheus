morpheus - a statically linked musl based Linux distro
======================================================

Building
--------

*** HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - READ THE CODE FIRST! ***

To build  morpheus you  currently need an  x86_64/x86 host.   You will
need to have mk(1) from 9base or plan9port.

Please review config.mk prior to building and adjust any parameters.

Setting up the environment:

  export mkbuild=$(pwd)/mkbuild
  export configmk=$(pwd)/config.mk
  export PATH=/path/to/musl/toolchain/bin:$PATH

Clone the git submodules, either via git commands or:

  mk init

To build everything (though this isn't recommended):

  mk

To build specific ports:

  mk TARG="port1 port2 ..."

  or:

  cd ports/port1; mk

To force build ports:

  mk -a

To clean the build system's cache:

  mk clean

To clean source dirs completely:

  mk distclean

To fetch all ports without building anything:

  mk fetch

To generate a package tarball:

  mk TARG="port1 port2 ..." package

You can then install the package using installpkg(1) from
http://git.2f30.org/pkgtools.

To install a port to the rootfs:

  mk TARG="port1 port2 ..." ROOT=$(pwd)/root install

Note that this however will *not* create the /var/log/packages
entries.

For a bootable system you need at least the following packages:

	busybox
	e2fsprogs
	extlinux
	file
	fs
	hbase
	linux
	mksh
	sbase
	sdhcp
	sinit
	smdev
	ubase

There are precompiled versions at http://morpheus.2f30.org/0.0 for the
x86_64 architecture.

We  suggest using  a  stripped-down CRUX  rootfs  for building  ports.

Rebuilding the kernel
---------------------

There is a default config for  the kernel in ports/linux.  The default
config is  copied over  .config in the  kernel source  directory every
time you do a build via mk(1).   You can adjust your local .config and
copy  it over  the  relevant config  in ports/linux  or  you can  just
manually  compile  the  kernel  and copy  System.map  and  bzImage  to
$ROOT/boot.

Installing
----------

There is currently no installer.  There is a script that creates a 2GB
image file that is suitable to dd to a usb stick.

To create a bootable image:

  sudo modprobe -r loop
  sudo modprobe loop max_part=15 # to be done only once
  sudo mk ROOT=$(pwd)/root bootable # set ROOT to point to your rootfs

Make sure to change  the kernel command line to point  it to your root
device.  You can do this at the boot prompt:

  bzImage root=/dev/sd[X]1 rootwait ro

Otherwise modify ports/extlinux/extlinux.conf and rebuild the extlinux
port or directly modify $ROOT/boot/extlinux.conf.

You will also want to modify the fstab file.

Testing
-------

To experiment with the x86_64 image in qemu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -hda morpheus-x86_64-0.0.img -enable-kvm -vga cirrus

Login with root and an empty password.

Debugging
---------

In some  cases you may  want to set nprocs to 1  in order to  get sane
build output. You can then use something like the following:

  mk 2>&1 | tee -a output.log

Props

I'd like to thank the people behind the sabotage-linux project.
Their work has been really helpful to us.
