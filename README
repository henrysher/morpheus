Morpheus is a statically linked musl based toy distro.

The base system includes  sbase[1], ubase[2], sdhcp[3], smdev[4], mksh
as well as other tools.

To build the  world use `./stage0'.  You need an  x86_64 host to build
morpheus.  Please review the  `prepare-env' script and adjust anything
needed.

Morpheus has been build-tested on Debian 7.0, Archlinux, Slackware and
Ubuntu 13.04.  It does *not* build with dash.

To build specific packages:

  ./pkgbuild pkgpath1 pkgpath2 ...

After you've built stage0 you can create a bootable image:

  sudo modprobe -r loop
  sudo modprobe loop max_part=15 # to be done only once
  sudo ./create-bootable

This creates a 512MB  image.  You can dd this image to  a USB stick if
you want to.  Make sure to change  the kernel command line to point it
to your root device.

Login with root and an empty password.

Enjoy!
