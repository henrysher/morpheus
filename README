Morpheus is a statically linked musl based distro.

To build the world use `fakeroot ./stage0'.

To build a particular package use `fakeroot ./pkgbuild <package>'.
You will then need to repack the rootfs with `fakeroot ./repack'.

Execute `qemu-run' (you will need vde_switch and slirpvde).

Login with `root' and an empty password.

Some of the packages are pulled from http://dl.2f30.org/morpheus-pkgs/
others are cloned from http://git.2f30.org.

Enjoy!
