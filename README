Morpheus is a statically linked musl based distro.

The base system includes  sbase[1], ubase[2], sdhcp[3], smdev[4], mksh
as well as other tools.

To build the  world use `fakeroot ./stage0'.  You need  an x86_64 host
to  build  morpheus.   Please  review the  stage0  script  and  adjust
anything needed.

To build a particular package  use `fakeroot ./pkgbuild pkgpath'.

After you've built  stage0 you can create a bootable  image with `sudo
./create-bootable'.  You'll  first need to  load the loop  module with
with the parameter max_part=15.  You can  dd this image to a USB stick
if you need to.  Make sure to  change the kernel command line to point
it to your root device.

Login with `root' and an empty password.

Enjoy!
